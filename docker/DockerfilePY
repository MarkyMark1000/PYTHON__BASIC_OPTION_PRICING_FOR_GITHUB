# The two DockerFiles in this directory are experiamental.   I wanted to get some practice in
# with docker, so created one that uses ubuntu (this one) and one that uses the python image
# as a base.   The python one was my second attempt and much simpler.
# Making matplotlib work, looks like more effort, so I decided to leave it for now.

# Use python image
FROM python:3.7

# Change working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy requirements file
COPY ./ ./

# Install requirements
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
RUN pip install -e .

# Run script
